What is CASP?
======

CASP (Coordinate-wise Adaptive Shrinkage Prediction) is a novel shrinkage rule for prediction in a high-dimensional non-exchangeable hierar-
chical Gaussian model with an unknown spiked covariance structure. CASP uses results on the behavior of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of
high-dimensional sample covariance matrix (Baik and Silverstein, 2006, Onatski, 2012, Paul, 2007), to
develop a bias-correction principle that leads to an efficient approach for evaluating the Bayes predictors corresponding to popular loss functions such as
quadratic, generalized absolute, and linex losses.
